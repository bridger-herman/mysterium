Players need to:
- View all people, place, and thing cards
    - Those cards need to be shown as disabled when players have correctly identified them
- View all vision cards, but know which ones are theirs
- eventually be able to select their guesses
    - eventually eventually be able to use clairvoyance tokens and keep totals

Ghost needs to:
- view all people/place/thing cards, but also know each player's final card pairing
- show Vision cards to everyone, but marked for a specific player
    - generally doesn't need to hide things, just show them in certain orders
- eventually have the ability to draw Vision cards from the deck and select them to give to players, and also to discard/redraw Vision cards
- eventually be able to tell players whether their guesses are right or wrong

That's probably too much info to start with, but it's really interesting to think about how the game mechanism breaks down!

But yeah, I think viewing/disabling the people/place/thing cards is first, and then viewing Vision cards after that.
